Multi-Wallet & Transaction Scanner with Token Creation Module
This repository contains a Multi-Wallet & Transaction Scanner project for tracking Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) transactions, with an additional module for token creation on Ethereum. The project automatically scans for transactions every 3 seconds, providing near real-time updates on wallet activity.

Features
1. Automatic Wallet Address Generation
New User Registration: When a user registers, the system automatically generates unique Ethereum and Bitcoin wallet addresses.
Instant Scanning Activation: After wallet creation, transaction scanning for the newly generated addresses begins immediately, ensuring all activity is tracked from the start.
2. Multi-Wallet Tracking
Supports tracking of multiple wallets for both Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC).
Configurable to add/remove wallets dynamically for comprehensive monitoring.
3. Transaction Scanner
Automatic Scanning Interval: The scanner checks for new transactions every 3 seconds, ensuring timely updates and tracking.
Monitors incoming and outgoing transactions for each wallet.
Provides real-time notifications for transactions, allowing immediate awareness of any wallet activities.
4. Ethereum Token Creation Module
Simplifies ERC-20 token creation on the Ethereum blockchain.
Offers customizable options for token properties like name, symbol, supply, and decimals.
Built with flexibility to adjust token parameters and deploy quickly on the Ethereum network.

Project Structure
scanner/: Contains the core scripts for scanning ETH and BTC transactions.
wallets/: Wallet configuration files for tracking addresses.
tokens/: Modules for creating ERC-20 tokens on Ethereum.
utils/: Utility functions and helper scripts.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Node.js and npm
Web3.js for Ethereum connectivity
Bitcoin.js for BTC transactions
Access to an Ethereum node (e.g., Infura) and a Bitcoin node
Installation
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/multi-wallet-scanner.git cd multi-wallet-scanner
Install dependencies:
bash
Copy code
npm install
Configure environment variables:
Add wallet addresses and API keys for both Ethereum and Bitcoin.
Specify the Ethereum node URL (e.g., Infura) and the Bitcoin node URL.
Run the project:
bash
Copy code
npm start

Usage
Registration and Wallet Initialization
When a user registers, unique Ethereum and Bitcoin addresses are automatically generated.
The system begins scanning transactions for each new wallet within 3 seconds of creation, providing immediate tracking and visibility.
Transaction Scanning
Scans for new transactions on both Ethereum and Bitcoin every 3 seconds.
Logs transaction details for each wallet, including:
Timestamp
Sender and receiver addresses
Transaction amount
Token transfers (if any)
Token Creation
Navigate to the tokens/ directory to access the token creation script.
Customize token properties as needed (name, symbol, supply).
Run the script to deploy a new token on the Ethereum network.

Highlights
Near Real-Time Monitoring: The 3-second interval ensures that transactions are detected almost as soon as they occur.
Automatic Address Generation: New wallet addresses are generated and monitored from the moment of user registration.
Multi-Wallet Compatibility: Supports an extensive range of wallets, enabling wide-ranging transaction tracking.
Modular Token Creation: Allows users to create and deploy ERC-20 tokens seamlessly.

This version of the README should make it clear that wallet addresses are generated at registration, with immediate transaction scanning. Let me know if you'd like further details or adjustments!


Yes, there are several distinct features in this project that set it apart, especially if it's aimed at providing comprehensive wallet tracking, automated token creation, and instant transaction scanning. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the key features that could be highlighted for your project:
Automatic Wallet Generation on Registration
Upon user registration, the system automatically generates both Ethereum and Bitcoin wallet addresses. This eliminates the need for manual wallet setup, streamlining the onboarding process.
Instant Scanning Activation
Once a wallet is created, transaction scanning starts within seconds. This feature ensures that transactions are tracked immediately from wallet creation, preventing any gaps in transaction history.
Real-Time Multi-Wallet Transaction Monitoring
The system continuously scans for transactions across multiple wallets every 3 seconds. This near real-time scanning frequency ensures that wallet activities are up-to-date and can provide timely notifications for every transaction.
Multi-Asset Compatibility
Tracks both Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) transactions, allowing users to manage multiple digital assets from a single platform.
Detailed Transaction Logging
Each transaction is logged with comprehensive details like timestamps, sender and receiver addresses, transaction amounts, and token transfers, if applicable. This is ideal for users who need detailed records for accounting, security, or monitoring purposes.
Ethereum ERC-20 Token Creation Module
Includes a feature for creating ERC-20 tokens on Ethereum, where users can set parameters like token name, symbol, supply, and decimals. This feature simplifies token deployment, making it accessible even to users with minimal blockchain experience.
Configurable Wallet Management
Provides flexibility to add or remove wallets dynamically, allowing for robust multi-wallet management. This is especially useful for users who may need to track various wallets across different projects or purposes.
Notifications for Wallet Activities
Real-time notifications alert users of any transactions within monitored wallets, making it easier to stay informed of account activity without constant manual checks.

These features collectively make your project a powerful tool for anyone looking to track crypto assets, manage wallets, or create tokens on Ethereum. The 3-second scanning interval is a unique selling point, as it ensures timely updates for users, which can be a major advantage for security, trading, and active monitoring.
